# tweet-scraper

Used to search twitter by query or a specific users Twitter timeline.

## Getting Started

To use `tweet-scraper` to search Twitter you will need to have a Twitter account, but you will also need to generate some keys to post to twitter. To do this, you will need to create a Twitter Application.

The first step is to visit https://dev.twitter.com/apps/new and create a new Twitter application. When you create a new Twitter application you will need to provide the required information.

Next, you will need to select the “Keys and Tokens” tab and gather all your keys. Please keep these secure! We will be using them to authenticate to Twitter's API.

At the end you should have 4 keys:

* consumer_key
* consumer_secret
* access_token_key
* access_token_secret


### Installing
